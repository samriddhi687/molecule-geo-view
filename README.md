 🧪 Molecular Geometry Viewer
This project helps us to visualize molecules in 3D using data from `.xyz` files.  
This script reads atomic coordinates from an XYZ file and displays the molecular geometry with labeled atoms in a 3D scatter plot.
---
## 📂 Features
- Reads molecular structure from standard `.xyz` files.
- Displays atoms in a 3D interactive plot.
- Labels each atom with its chemical symbol.
- Provides sample molecule names for quick testing (e.g., `water.xyz`, `methane.xyz`, `carbondioxide.xyz`, `ammonia.xyz`).

## ⚙️ Requirements
Make sure you have the following installed:
- [matplotlib] 
You can install matplotlib with:
pip install matplotlib
